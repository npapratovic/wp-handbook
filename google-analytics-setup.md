## How to activate Universal Analytics after activation of GA4 Analytics

You can create Universal Analytics or better both versions of Google Analytics, GA4, and Universal Analytics property.  
Below are the steps you need to take to create either or both of the properties.

1. Click on Create Property Button in Admin Panel
2. Scroll down and you will see a link called "Show Advanced Options", click on it
3. In this screen, you will see a toggle button to create Univeral Analytics (UA) property, toggle it
4. Select your options to either create both GA4 and UA properties or just UA property. I recommend creating both.

After Universal Analytics setup - now we can setup ecommerce tracking on our webshop: [how-to-setup-ecommerce-tracking.md](how-to-setup-ecommerce-tracking.md)
